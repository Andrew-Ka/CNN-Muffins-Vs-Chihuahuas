# CNN-Muffins-Vs-Chihuahuas
Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks, I made a model that can tell the difference between a chihuahua and a muffin.

## Getting Started

This whole project and file can be run in Google Colab. Alternatively, it can be run on Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle, or any other Interactive Python Notebook (ipynb) software/service.

### Prerequisites

If using Google CoLab
* A Google Account
If using another source
* Anaconda - Instillation of Jupyter Notebook
* Python

### Installing

If using Google CoLab, no instillation is required.   
If using an alternative software, then simple download the raw ipynb file.


## Running the tests

Each cell in the file contains either markdown or python code. Running the cell is as simple as "Ctrl + Enter" or if available, a little play button.

### Sample Tests

## Deployment

If the model suits a specific purpose, the model can be saved by saving the history variable, perhaps under a log file. This can then be accessed and deployed as neccessary. 

## Built With

  * Google CoLab
